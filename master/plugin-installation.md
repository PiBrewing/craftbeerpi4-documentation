# Plugin installation

## Plugin installation process

Craftbeerpi4 comes with very basic functionality but has the possibility to use plugins provided by the community. Therefore, it has a huge flexibility as Sensors, Actors Controllers, Recipe creation plugins but also Push Messages and Displays can be added to each users need (The user just needs to write his plugin or needs to find someone who is providing it).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is currently no possibility to install plugins automatically via the integrated plugin page. All plugins need to be installed via the path described below. The plugin page does only show the installed plugins.
{% endhint %}

CraftbeerPi4 comes for instance with a Onewire temperature sensor, but some users prefer a PT100/PT1000 sensor. Therefore, a variety of plugins is already available and below is an example on how to install a PT100/PT1000 sensor plugin.

Some plugins have been made available via pypi.org and can be installed directly from there. Other plugins need to be installed directly from GitHub. The cbpi4-pt100X plugin is available on both platforms. Typically, the latest version is available on GitHub and will be released a bit later via pypi.org as package

Installation from pypi.org is quite simple. Just type the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```
source ~/.local/pipx/venvs/cbpi4/bin/activate
```

And install the plugin with:

```
python -m pip install cbpi4-pt100x
```

The plugin and it's dependent packages will be installed on your system and cbpi will detect it automatically.

The other way to install the plugin is directly from GitHub:

```
python -m pip install https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-pt100x/archive/main.zip
```

Also here, the plugin and the dependent packages will be installed automatically.

Once this is completed, you need to leave the virtual environment with:

```
deactivate
``` 

And restart cbpi or reboot your server.

{% hint style="info" %}
To get some detailed information about the plugin configuration and how to connect/install your sensor, you should have always a look at the plugin page on GitHub or pypi.org. I always try to add the most important information in the corresponding README.

For the cbpi4-pt100x plugin, you can find the information [here](https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-pt100x) on GitHub or you search for cbpi4-pt100x on the pypi.org site.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please always remember, that plugins can also add global settings during the installation that need to be set in the [settings page](craftbeerpi-4-server/settings.md). One example is for instance the [cbpi4-pushover ](https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-Pushover)Plugin which adds the parameters pushover\__user and pushover\__key to the global settings..
{% endhint %}

## How to update a plugin?

If there is a new version of a plugin you can simply re-install the plugin or run an upgrade. Below is the example for the cbpi-pt100x plugin:

#### Re-Installation (always inside the virtual environment as descried above):

```
python -m pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-pt100x/archive/main.zip
```

#### Upgrade (always inside the virtual environment as descried above):

```
python -m pip install --upgrade https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-pt100x/archive/main.zip
```
{% hint style="info" %}
The update/upgrade or re-installation can be also done cia pypi.org if the plugin has been published there via the plugin name as shown above.
{% endhint %}
## How to remove a plugin?

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to remove a plugin you need to be careful. Before you remove the plugin from the server, you need to ensure that the plugin is not in use in any of your Hardware items and the dashboard as this may cause errors and can prevent the server from starting
{% endhint %}

To remove the plugin from the cbpi server, just type in case of the cbpi4-pt100x plugin:

```
python -m pip uninstall cbpi4-pt100x
```

inside the virtual environment.

## How to show the installed/active plugins?

If you want to see the active plugins, you have two possibilities. The first option is from the command line. Just type:

```
cbpi plugins
```

This will show you a list of the installed plugins incl. the version:

```

The second option is directly from the user interface. Just click on the menu button on the top left and select Plugins. This will show this page which is still in development. However, you can see the active plugins and if the developer has added the corresponding information to his plugin, you can go directly to the corresponding webpage of the Plugin.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can't install, activate or deactivate plugins on this page. It only shows the plugins you have installed and activated via command line.
